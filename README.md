# SvelteKit

## Research Conducted By: Student Names

## Overall Score and Comments

### Score (Out of 10): 8

### General Comments

SvelteKit is a Fullstack-ish framework that is lightweight and offers an allegedly positive DX, although in our experience, the learning curve coming from React is a bit steep.

### Pros

Simple syntax for reactivity (mimics mutation syntax)
Script and style tags in components
Lightweight
Lots of little extra quality of life features
Demo comes with two different examples of functionality

### Cons

Steep learning curve
File naming conventions are not intuitive
Distinction between svelete and sveltekit is not clear for beginners using the recommended template
Documentation is stale in some places and is not easy to navigate
Counter component in the demo uses some extra complexity for animation that is not related to the core functionality of the framework

## Ratings and Reviews

### Systems Requirements

No core requirements other than node and a package manager. npx will install the necessary dependencies.

### Ramp-Up Projections

1-2 weeks seems reasonable for someone already experienced in frontend development to become quite productive, but there is a learning curve.

### Community Support and Adoption levels

People love it. We're not yet sure that we do. It came in just behind SolidJS in the StateofJS survey, with around 90% retention for people who tried it. It is gaining traction, though adoption is still virtually nonexistent in industry compared to React and even Angular and Vue.
